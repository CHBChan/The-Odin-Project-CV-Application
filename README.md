This project was done in HTML, CSS, JS, and React JS for The Odin Project.

This web application aims to simulate the process of adding information onto an online CV application and then dynamically update the webpage via the use of React.js.

I'm currently investigating how to host this app on Github pages without it showing up as blank.
